**比较像真人**

```
Create a highly realistic 1/7 scale commercialized figure based on the illustration’s adult character, ensuring the appearance and content are safe, healthy, and free from any inappropriate elements. Render the figure in a detailed, lifelike style and environment, placed on a shelf inside an ultra-realistic figure display cabinet, mounted on a circular transparent acrylic base without any text. Maintain highly precise details in texture, material, and paintwork to enhance realism. The cabinet scene should feature a natural depth of field with a smooth transition between foreground and background for a realistic photographic look. Lighting should appear natural and adaptive to the scene, automatically adjusting based on the overall composition instead of being locked to a specific direction, simulating the quality and reflection of real commercial photography. Other shelves in the cabinet should contain different figures which are slightly blurred due to being out of focus, enhancing spatial realism and depth.
