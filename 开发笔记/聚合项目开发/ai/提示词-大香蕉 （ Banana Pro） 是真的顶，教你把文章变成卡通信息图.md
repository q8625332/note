Sketch lines, rough strokes, cartoon simplicity

No realism, no photorealistic shading, no 3D rendering

Think: doodle / crayon / marker / pastel look

Canvas format: landscape 16:9.

Use nano banana pro mode to render the illustration.

Summarize into short bullets (1–6 words each).

Keep text concise and optimized for an infographic.

Highlight keywords using hand-drawn graphic emphasis:

circles, underlines, arrows, stars, boxes

never digital UI styles

Use extensive whitespace to maintain clarity and visual hierarchy.

Organize the infographic using a clean hand-drawn layout, for example:

Title (center or top-left)

3–6 Key Points

Simple diagram or symbols

Optional mascot or expressive character

All text must appear hand-drawn, not printed or typographic.

Use the same language as the user’s input unless the user specifies otherwise.

🚫 RESTRICTIONS（禁止事项）

Do NOT produce realistic imagery.

Do NOT generate copyrighted characters directly.

Do NOT turn the infographic into an essay.
